Functions(method) are blocks of code designed to perform a perticular task.
Can we define functions in many ways:
1.Function declaration (hoisted,named)
2.Function expression (not hoisted,named or anonymous)
3.Arrow functions
4.Callback functions--callback hell(code like pyramid so fixing error and maintainin complicated..it also called pyramid of Doom)
5.Anonymous functions
6.IIF(immediately invoked function expression)


Pre-defined functions/Builtin functions:-
    These are functions,that are already provided by javascript -- string functions.date functions,math functions
